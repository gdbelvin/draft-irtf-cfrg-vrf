# Verifiable Random Function (VRF)

A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is the public-key version of a keyed
cryptographic hash, and are useful for preventing enumeration of hash-based
data structures.  

- Only the holder of the private key can compute the hash.
- Anyone with public key can verify the correctness of the hash.  

## Status
This repository contains a **draft** implementation of 
[draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf/)
and is a work in progress.
